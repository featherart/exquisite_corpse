This is a game of exquisite corpse, which is not nearly as creepy as it sounds. It's basically a game where 3 different people draw 3 different parts of a body without anyone seeing what the other has drawn. It takes inspiration from the French Dadaist artists who played this game with sentences in Parisian Cafes at the turn of the century.

It is not yet complete! However, what is working so far can be found at:
